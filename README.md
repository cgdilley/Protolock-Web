# Protolock webpage

Don't judge me, I'm not a front-end dev :P

Webage can be found at: [protolock.sprelf.com](https://protolock.sprelf.com)

This is just a simple page used for inputting the board state of a Mezzonic Protolock from Zereth Mortis,
and making an API call to generate a solution to display.  Pretty straightforward!

See [this repo](https://github.com/cgdilley/Protolock-Backend) for the backend code, that's where the fun stuff is.
